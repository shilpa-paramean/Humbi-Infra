# Security

Citadel Well-architected Foundation applies a set of IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles across the AWS accounts to apply the concept of least privilege and provide exactly the needed policy at the time for users and systems. The concepts of least privilege implemented comply with CPS 234 in the Roles and Responsibilities session.

All configurations were applied using infrastructure-as-code using Terraform in the identity stack in this repo.

In this platform, most of the regular access to AWS cloud will be using SSO (Single Sign On) using the organisation's GSuite, Azure AD or AWS SSO.
